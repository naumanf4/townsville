                <p class="pe-3 smallText">Townsville City Council wants to make it easier for your
                    business to have outdoor dining. Outdoor dining increases
                    your business' seating capacity and gives life to the street,
                    making it a more fun place for people to visit. Council's
                    Outdoor Dining Permit system provides a simple and free
                    process for fast approvals, allowing you to get your permit
                    and get back to running your businesses.
                    <br/>
                    Applying for a permit is free and most of the time it can be
                    sent instantly to your email address.
